# Project Report

### Which Programming Language and version did you pick?
> <pre>
> For this project I chose to explore the C# programming language using the Visual Studio IDE. 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> C# Version 11
> </pre>
> <pre>
> .NET Version 7
> </pre>
> <pre>
> Visusal Studio Community 2022 Version 17.6.2
> </pre>

### Why did you pick this programming language?
> <pre>
> For this project I chose to explore the C# programming language because it is a widely used 
> general-purpose high-level language. C# is versatile in the industry and it is used today 
> to build a wide range of applications and web-based services. For example, C# is commonly used 
> for backend services, Windows applications, website development, and game development. 
> </pre>

### Explain how your programming language handles...
> <pre>
> 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> -  object-oriented programming
> </pre>
> <pre>
> -  file ingestion
> </pre>
> <pre>
> -  conditional statements
> </pre>
> <pre>
> -  assignment statements
> </pre>
> <pre>
> -  loops
> </pre>
> <pre>
> -  subprograms
> </pre>
> <pre>
> -  unit testing
> </pre>
> <pre>
> -  exception handling
> </pre>

### List 3 libraries you used (if applicable) and explain them. 
> <pre>
> For my project all of the libraries used were part of the System namespace.
> </pre>
> <pre>
> System.Diagnostics
>
> This provides classes that allow you to interact with system processes, event logs, and
> performance counters. It also provides classes that allow you to debug you application and
> trace the execution of your code. I used this library for the latter reason so I could write
> unit tests using the Debug.Assert method. I used them to test the functionality of my analytic
> methods that calulate the mean, median, and mode.
> </pre>
> <pre>
> System.Text.RegularExpressions
>
> This contains classes that represent ASCII and Unicode character encodings. It provides regular
> expression functionality that may be used from any platform or language that runs within the .NET
> framework. I used this library for regular expressions by using the Regex class and the Replace 
> and Match methods. I used these to aid in cleaning the data that was parsed from the csv file. 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> System.Collections
>
> This contains interfaces and classes that define various collections of objects, such as lists,
> queues, bit arrays, hash tables, and dictionaries. I used this library for the Hashtable class,
> which represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of 
> the key. I used this to create the column oriented cell table because the values are allowed to
> have different data types.
> </pre>
