# Project Report

### Which Programming Language and version did you pick?
> <pre>
> For this project I chose to explore the C# programming language using the Visual Studio IDE. 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> C# Version 11
> </pre>
> <pre>
> .NET Version 7
> </pre>
> <pre>
> Visusal Studio Community 2022 Version 17.6.2
> </pre>

### Why did you pick this programming language?
> <pre>
> For this project I chose to explore the C# programming language because it is a widely used 
> general-purpose high-level language. C# is versatile in the industry and it is used today 
> to build a wide range of applications and web-based services. For example, C# is commonly 
> used for backend services, Windows applications, website development, and game development. 
>
> The primary reason I was interested in taking a deep dive into C# was for game development.
> As a hobbyist game developer that uses the Unity game development engine, which uses C# for
> scripting, I wanted to better understand the tools at my disposal and step up my game to 
> build better experiences (until now I only had peripheral experience with the language 
> because you can accomplish a lot with the GUI, but you can better customize an experience
> by writing more of your own code). 
>
> Additionally, I was interested in exploring C# for pratical reasons. To elaborate, I've heard 
> C# being called Java's sister language and I thought it would be useful to learn a language 
> that was similair to Java because it is the language I am most familair with, and I would
> like to get comfortable with as many languages as possible before schools over (to pad my
> resume with a larger skill set). 
> </pre>

### Explain how your programming language handles...
> <pre>
> Because this project has us exploring a languge that is an alternative to Java, and because
> Java is my primary frame of reference when it comes to programming, I will explore the 
> following concepts as they relate to Java (similarities/differences). 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> object-oriented programming
>
> In my experience C# handles incorporating OOP concepts very similarly to Java. To elaborate,
> C# uses classes and objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. There are some 
> minor syntax differences between the languages but there is robust documentation for 
> C# online so it was easy to find what I needed. Visual Studio made it easy to organize 
> my classes, similar to using IntelliJ IDEA. 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> file ingestion
>
> In my experience C# handles file ingestion (particularly for csv/text) very similarly to
> Java. To elaborate, like Java, C# has a File class that lets you check if a file exists 
> before ingesting the data. To ingest the file I used a Stream Reader in C#, where I use
> the Buffer Reader in Java. One difference was that in C# you can perfrom file ingestion
> in a Using block so you don't have to explicitly close the Reader object after use.
> </pre>
> <pre>
> conditional statements
>
> In my experience C# handles conditional statements very similarly to Java. To elaborate, 
> C# supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics, and the if, if-else, and else 
> statements all work like they do in Java (including nesting conditinals).  
> </pre>
> <pre>
> assignment statements
>
> In my experience C# handles assignment statements very similarly to Java. To elaborate,
> in both languages you can assign a variable to a value using the equals sign (and accessing
> these assigned variables follow the same rules of scoping in both languages). Also, both 
> languages are strongly typed, meaning that variable assignment must be associated with a 
> data type. In C# you can implicity assign a data type using the var keyword (but I think 
> java has added this functionality, but it's not a convention I use in Java). In C# you 
> can also make primitive data types nullable, which I found helpful for this project. 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> loops
>
> In my experience C# handles loops very similarly to Java. To elaborate, both for loops and 
> while loops use the same syntax and seem to function the same way in both languages. I did
> notice that the for each loop in C# has a slightly differrent syntax than in Java though. 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> subprograms
>
> In my experience C# handles subprograms very similarly to Java. To elaborate, in both 
> languages you have to declare data types for parameters and return statements (or void
> if the subprogram doesn't return anything). Also, in both languages methods can be 
> declared as static (or not). Method calls are also the same in both languages. 
> Additionally, both languages allow for method overloading, but in C# method overriding 
> uses a different syntax than in Java.
> </pre>
> <pre>
> unit testing
>
> In my experience C# handles unit testing very similarly to Java. To elaborate, in both 
> languages you use Assert statments to test the functionality of methods. These can 
> be included in your code or kept seperate using a testing framework. The MSTest 
> framework works a little differently than using gradle in IntelliJ. In Visual Studio,
> you have to create a seperate Unit Test Project to use the framework. For my unit 
> testing I experimented with in project unit testing and using the MSTest framework.
> I ultimatly chose to use Debug.Asserts in my main program to keep all my testing in 
> one place. In C#, Debug.Asserts are cool because the asserts are only evaluated when
> running the code under the debugger (development console) and not evaluated in a 
> release build (so there is no additional overhead).
> </pre>
> <pre>
> exception handling
>
> In my experience C# handles exceptions very similarly to Java. To elaborate, both languages 
> have built in exceptions that you can handle using try/catch blocks or throw statements. You 
> can also avoid throwing exceptions by performing conditional checks before executing your code 
> and if they fail you can display a console message for the user instead of throwing the exception 
> and interrupting your program. 
> </pre>

### List 3 libraries you used (if applicable) and explain them. 
> <pre>
> For my project all of the libraries used were part of the System namespace.
> </pre>
> <pre>
> System.Diagnostics
>
> This provides classes that allow you to interact with system processes, event logs, and
> performance counters. It also provides classes that allow you to debug you application and
> trace the execution of your code. I used this library for the latter reason so I could write
> unit tests using the Debug.Assert method. I used them to test the functionality of my analytic
> methods that calulate the mean, median, and mode.
> </pre>
> <pre>
> System.Text.RegularExpressions
>
> This contains classes that represent ASCII and Unicode character encodings. It provides regular
> expression functionality that may be used from any platform or language that runs within the .NET
> framework. I used this library for regular expressions by using the Regex class and the Replace 
> and Match methods. I used these to aid in cleaning the data that was parsed from the csv file. 
> </pre>
> <pre>
> System.Collections
>
> This contains interfaces and classes that define various collections of objects, such as lists,
> queues, bit arrays, hash tables, and dictionaries. I used this library for the Hashtable class,
> which represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of 
> the key. I used this to create the column oriented cell table because the values are allowed to
> have different data types.
> </pre>
